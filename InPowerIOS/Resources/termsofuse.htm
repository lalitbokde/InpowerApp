    IT. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES

    OF A DISPUTE.
</p>
<p>

    What permissions does Bit:Möb receive due to a new subscriber signup?
</p>
<p align="justify">
    If you connect to Bit:Möb with Facebook Connect, Twitter, or any other service,
    you give us permission to access and use your information from Facebook, Twitter
    or other service as permitted by that service. Additionally, you agree that if you
    decide to use the Bit:Möb proximity based messaging, you will allow the system to
    access location data using your mobile device’s location based controls, including
    GPS. Since this is a proximity based messaging system, naturally the system will
    require your location info. But you knew that already, didn’t you!
</p>
<p align="justify">
    You may never use another User’s account without permission. You are solely responsible
    for the activity that occurs on your account. You must notify Bit:Möb immediately
    of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Bit:Möb will not
    be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing
    the settings. By providing Bit:Möb your email address you consent to our using the
    email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required
    by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail, which will likely only be used
    if you screw up and we have to notify the proper authorities. We may also use your
    email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service.
</p>
<p align="justify">

    dispute, or controversy (excluding any Bit:Möb claims for injunctive or other equitable
    relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the
    breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration
    by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in the city of Florida, NY under
    the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The
    award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable
    attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment
    on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
    jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Bit:Möb from
    seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect
    any of Bit:Möb’s proprietary interests.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
    OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT,
    BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Bit:Möb ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
    TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Once again, if you have a problem
    with this, then keep on heading down the highway, Pardner!
</p>
<p align="justify">
    These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of
    the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Should the
    arbitration provision above be found unenforceable for any reason, the exclusive
    jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these
    Terms of Service will be the state and federal courts located in Florida, and each
    of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
